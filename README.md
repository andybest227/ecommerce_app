# E-Commerce Application Backend (Microservices Architecture)
Welcome to the E-Commerce Application Backend, a robust and scalable backend system for an e-commerce platform built with Spring Boot. The application leverages a microservices architecture to ensure modularity, flexibility, and scalability.

# üöÄFeatures
- Microservices Architecture: Decoupled services for Order Management, Inventory, Payment, Notification, and User Authentication.
- Event-Driven Communication: Utilizes Apache Kafka for inter-service communication.
- Database Integration: Each microservice integrates with its own database using JPA and Hibernate.
- RESTful APIs: Clean and well-documented endpoints for seamless interaction.
- Secure Authentication: User authentication and authorization implemented using JWT.
- Scalable Deployment: Dockerized services for easy containerization and orchestration.
- Resilient Design: Circuit breakers and retry mechanisms with Spring Cloud Resilience4j.

# üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
# Core Frameworks and Tools:
1. Spring Boot (REST, Data JPA, Security, Cloud Config)
2. Spring Cloud (Eureka, Gateway, Config Server)

# Infrastructure:
1. Apache Kafka: Message broker for event-driven communication.
2. MySQL / PostgreSQL, MongoDB: Database for persistent storage.
3. Redis: Caching for session and data optimization.
4. Docker: Containerized microservices.

# Other Integrations:
1. Stripe / PayPal: Payment processing integration.
2. Swagger/OpenAPI: API documentation.
3. JUnit & Mockito: Unit and integration testing.
